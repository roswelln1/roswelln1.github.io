              Shrek Tek is a company started in 2016 by Drew Smith and Katie Klein
          dedicated to making the newest technological advancements available to
          everyone.

        While studying physics and astrology together at the University
        of Dayton, Drew and Katie began researching solar energy and made a
        discovery that would change not only their lives, but the lives of
        potentially millions. For years scientists have harnessed and utilized
        the suns solar rays, but no one ever imagined the moon’s lunar rays could
        be even more powerful. Drew and Katie found a way to capture these lunar
        rays and discovered that when the rays are applied to food, the calories vanish!
      </p>
    <p>
          Technology this advanced could be sold for billions, but Drew and Katie
      interests lied elsewhere. Rather than reserving the valuable technology to a
      select few, Katie and Drew founded “Shrek Tek”; a technology company that prides
      itself on providing the latest and greatest innovations in the science community
      to customers at an affordable price.
    </p>
    <p>
          Shrek Tek’s first product, EFF-it, is a fast acting calorie eliminator that
      has taken the world by storm. Our target market, college students, love the
      product because of its effectiveness and affordability. Shrek Tek believes that
      college students are the minds and leaders of the future.  Co-founders Drew
      and Katie know from experience how difficult college life can be, specifically
      in terms of maintaining personal health and financial budgeting. The EFF-it
      allows users to consume whatever they desire without the repercussions, gaining weight.

    <p>
          Shrek Tek believes the EFF-it will make our company a household name and pave
      the way for future product lines. But this is just the beginning. Here at Shrek
      Tek our customers are more then just sales, to us they are the future. Our
      employees and scientists share this belief and are dedicated to discovering
      innovative technology and providing it at an affordable price.
