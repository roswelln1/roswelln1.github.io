          Company Analysis
       </h3>
	     The team behind Shrek Tek is a young and passionate group of hard working team members. All in the their early to mid 30s the Shrek Tek team can easily relate to their target market. They can easily remember the struggle of staying fit and slim in college by reflecting on their semi-recent college carriers. What they lack in industry experience they make up for in passion. EFF-it is the brain-child of Drew and Katie. They have watched their idea marerialiate into a real and profitable product. Behind the two CEOs is an experienced team of business professionals and engineers who carry the same passion for the product as Drew and Katie.
	     As a startup the company is suffering from low funds due to the product demand increase. Initially, Shrek Tek was set on funds for a projected five years of gradual growth, however, that changed when various college campuses caught wind of the innovative tecnology that is EFF-it.

        Customer Analysis: Target Market
      </h3>
	    Shrek Tek is looking to target millenials and younger with the new product Eff-it. The millennials are now the largest population group, outnumbering the baby boomers. They have been researched to be more aware of their weight and exercise, thus being more inclined to take weight loss actions such as purchasing weight loss products. Millennials are also more inclined to use technology and seek out new and innovative technology. Millennials use fitness apps more than any other age group. Although Shrek Tek’s Eff-it is not exactly a fitness app or weight loss product is easily falls into these categories, fitting the trend qualifications for what millenials and those younger are looking for.
